    "# Bayesian Network to Analyse The Risks From Security Breach\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a securitiy breach, companies are required by regulations to evaluate the severity and the impact of that breach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing Risk Rating Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few risk rating methodology out there: ISO, COSO, Mehari, ISF, etc. My favorite is the [OWASP Risk Rating methodology](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) not because of it's coverage or precision, but because of it's speed. In situation where there are few hundred vulnerabilities, simplicity is necessary to provide a risk evaluation in a reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Risk = Likelihood * Impact\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a risk, we just need to evaluate the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited, and multiply this by the impact.\n",

    "But how about the vulnerabilities that did materialize? After performing an assessment, the analyst would have gained evidences that would have an influence on the overall risk rating, but by how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating Our Risk Rating From Evidences\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to answer to this question, my hypothesis is that we can use a Bayesian Network, start from our initial risk rating prior, and then, by adding factors, we can update our risk probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe requires companies to report security risks if they are judged likely to impact data subject, but there isn't a formula provided to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidances from the ICO and EU\n",
    "The UK Information Commisionner Office and the European Union provides the following guidance:\n",
    "* From the ICO: [Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation - Personal Data Breaches](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/)\n",
    "* From the Europan Union: [Guidelines On Personal data breach notification under Regulation 2016/679 wp250rev.01]( http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612052). Relevant Part: section IV of the Article 29\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "In a case like the Equifax breach, there is no question: The final risk can be evaluated as **The end of the world**... well, for anybody with a conscience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other type of incidents, it's not always clean cut. For example, the incident at [Twitter where clear text passwords were found in their logs](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/keeping-your-account-secure.html). Personal data (sensitive) was exposed... but was it leaked? While the passwords were in the logs, did anyone abused them? Do we need to report this breach to the authorities? How does our public image will suffer from this incident if we report it publicly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoiler: Twitter fixed the issue, resetted the passwords of all affected users (pretty much all), then issued a public statement explaining their conclusions and action taken. The public image didn't suffer at all. They actually became a role model on how to manage to an incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, let's use the twitter password incident as a background context. From there, we can try make up some criterias that they might have evaluated. With all this configured, we can then create scenarios and query our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criterias\n",
    "The Europan Union Guidelines on Personal data breach notification mentions that the following factors should be evaluated.\n",
    "* Type of breach: Confidentiality breach\n",
    "* Nature of the personal data: Passwords\n",
    "* Sensitivity of the personal data: sensitive\n",
    "* Volume of personal data: All users\n",
    "* Ease of identification of individuals: Easy\n",
    "* Special characteristics of the individuals: No medical data or anything that sensitive, but Twitter users could have sensitive private direct messages\n",
    "* Special characteristics of the data controller: messages, names, phone numbers\n",
    "* Number of affected individuals: Millions\n",
    "* General points to identify: \n",
    "    * Severity\n",
    "    * Potential impact\n",
    "    * Likelihood of these occurring\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploitation scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "For our threat actor: let's say that the most likely one would be an employee or partner staff. That employee would have access to the user logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter has: \n",
    "* ~3,400 employees\n",
    "* ~335,000,000 Monthly active users\n",
    "* 10TB of logs per day (guestimate, I have no source for that number)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: What is the likelihood that an employee would notice the passwords and use them for their personal interest?\n",
    "Hypothesis 1: Given how many employees Twitter has. Let's be pesimistic:\n",
    "* Percentage of employees who have access to the user logs: 55% (engineering company, most likely that all engineers have access to logs for debugging purposes), so ~1870 employees should have access to the logs\n",
    "* Guestimate of the likelihood that somebody would notice the passwords: 2%, about 37.4 employees would notice the passwords\n",
    "* Guestimate of the likelihood that someone who noticed the data would try to abuse it: 1%, 0.37 employee might want to use the password for his personal gain\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What is the potential gain?\n",
    "Hypothesis 2: Potential gain could expect from using that data: potentially high, because we know that users reuse their passwords everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: What are the likely outcome if an employee is caught exploiting these passwords?\n",
    "* Consequences for the employee if caught: really, really bad: loss of job, criminal record"
